      <title>DualPanto: A Haptic Device that Enables Blind Users to Continuously Interact with Virtual Worlds</title>

      <description>We present a new haptic device that enables blind users to continuously track the absolute position of moving objects in spatial virtual environments, as is the case in sports or shooter games. Users interact with DualPanto by operating the me handle with one hand and by holding on to the it handle with the other hand.
Each handle is connected to a pantograph haptic input/output device. The key feature is that the two handles are spatially registered with respect to each other.</description>

      <title>Self avatar pseudo-haptics in Virtual Reality</title>

      <description>We propose a system that presents a feeling of resistive force by modifying joint angles of user’s avatar, and an approach to reduce a feeling of discomfort evoked by a conflict between visual and proprioceptive sensations. Pseudo-haptic feedback enables us to provide haptic sensations by making discrepancy between the position of user’s body in the real world and avatar which represents a part of user’s body in an immersive virtual environment without using any complicated devices.</description>
